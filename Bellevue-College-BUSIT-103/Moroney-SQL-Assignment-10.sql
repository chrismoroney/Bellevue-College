--You are to develop SQL statements for each task listed.  
--You should type your SQL statements under each task.  

--  It is your responsibility to provide a meaningful column name for the return value of the function.
--  These statements will NOT use GROUP BY or HAVING. Those keywords are introduced in the next module. One cell 
--	results sets (one column and one row) do not need to have an ORDER BY clause.

--	Recall that sales to resellers are stored in the FactResellerSales table and sales to customers are stored in
--	the FactInternetSales table. 

--	Do not remove the USE statement
USE AdventureWorksDW2012;

-- 1.a.	Find the count of customers who are married. Be sure give each derived field 
--		an appropriate alias.

--1.b.	Check your result. Write queries to determine if the answer to 1.a. is correct.
--		You should be writing proofs for all of your statements.
