--You are to develop SQL statements for each task listed.  
--You should type your SQL statements under each task.  

--  It is your responsibility to provide a meaningful column name for the return value of the function 
--  and use an appropriate sort order. All joins are to use the ANSI standard syntax.

USE AdventureWorksDW2012;

--1.	AdventureWorks wants geographic information about its resellers.
--		Be sure to add a meaningful sort as appropriate and give each derived column an alias.

--1a.	First check to determine if there are resellers without geography info.


SELECT * 
FROM [dbo].[DimReseller] AS r INNER JOIN [dbo].[DimGeography] AS g ON r.GeographyKey = g.GeographyKey
WHERE r.GeographyKey IS NULL;


--1b.	Display a count of resellers in each Country.
--		Show country name and the count of resellers.


SELECT g.EnglishCountryRegionName, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfResellers
FROM [dbo].[DimReseller] AS r INNER JOIN [dbo].[DimGeography] AS g ON r.GeographyKey = g.GeographyKey
GROUP BY g.EnglishCountryRegionName
ORDER BY NumberOfResellers, g.EnglishCountryRegionName ASC;


--1c.	Display a count of resellers in each City. 
--		Show count of resellers, City name, State name, and Country name.
 

SELECT COUNT(*) AS NumberOFResellers, g.City, g.StateProvinceName, g.EnglishCountryRegionName
FROM [dbo].[DimReseller] AS r INNER JOIN [dbo].[DimGeography] AS g ON r.GeographyKey = g.GeographyKey
GROUP BY g.City, g.StateProvinceName, g.EnglishCountryRegionName
ORDER BY EnglishCountryRegionName, City, StateProvinceName ASC;


--2.	AdventureWorks wants banking and historical information about its resellers.
--		Be sure to add a meaningful sort as appropriate and give each derived column an alias. 

--2a. 	Check to see if there are any resellers without a value in the bank name field.


SELECT *
FROM [dbo].[DimReseller]
WHERE BankName IS NULL


--2b.	List the name of each bank and the number of resellers using that bank.


SELECT BankName, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfResellers
FROM [dbo].[DimReseller]
GROUP BY BankName
ORDER BY NumberOfResellers, BankName ASC;


--2c.	List the year opened and the number of resellers opening in that year.


SELECT YearOpened, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfResellers
FROM [dbo].[DimReseller]
GROUP BY YearOpened
ORDER BY NumberOfResellers, YearOpened ASC;


--2d.	List the order frequency and the number of resellers with that order frequency.


SELECT OrderFrequency, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfResellers
FROM [dbo].[DimReseller]
GROUP BY OrderFrequency
ORDER BY NumberOfResellers, OrderFrequency ASC;


--2e.	List the average number of employees in each of the three business types.


SELECT BusinessType, AVG(NumberEmployees) AS AvgNumberEmployees

GROUP BY BusinessType
ORDER BY AvgAnnualRevenue, NumberOfResellers, BusinessType ASC;


--3.	AdventureWorks wants information about sales to its resellers. Be sure to add a 
--		meaningful sort and give each derived column an alias. Remember that Annual Revenue 
--		is a measure of the size of the business and is NOT the total of the AdventureWorks 
--		products sold to the reseller. Be sure to use SalesAmount when total sales are 
--		requested.

--3a. 	List the name of any reseller to which AdventureWorks has not sold a product. 
--		Hint: Use a join.

--		Be sure to add a meaningful sort as appropriate and give each derived column an alias. 

--4a.	List customer education level (use EnglishEducation) and the number of customers reporting

--		each level of education, and the average yearly income for each level of education.
--		Show the average income rounded to two (2) decimal places.

--		Show the date of the most recent order as mm/dd/yyyy. 
--		Make sure you do not miss any customers. If you need to add one more field to the SELECT 
--		or the GROUP BY clause, go ahead. 


SELECT c.CustomerKey, CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', MiddleName, ' ', LastName) AS FullName, CONVERT(nvarchar, MAX(OrderDate), 101) AS MostRecentOrderDate
