-- All result-answers should be display with a single query statement
-- (not multiple statements)

-- Question 1 is worth 6 points
-- All other questions are worth 3 points each.

-- Use the following database for the following questions:
use [AdventureWorksDW2012];

-- You are amazing and most excellent! Go forth with peaceful mental clarity.
-- Check in with me if you have questions.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1.	For this first question - and only this first question - I am asking you to research, learn and use 
--		what is called a "self-join." There are many videos and tutorials that demonstrate "self-joins"
--		and I would like you to find one and mimic the code in order to answer this question.

--		You may have noticed, when creating diagrams, that some tables have a join line that connects into 
--		itself. This is because there is a relationship between two fields within the same table.

--		This is the case with the DimEmployee table. This table lists all employees by EmployeeKey. However, 
--		notice that each employee record has a field for ParentEmployeeKey which lists a value. The value in
--		the ParentEmployeeKey field is actually the EmployeeKey of a different employee in the table that 
--		manages that employee. For example, EmployeeKey=1 is Guy Gilbert. Guy is managed by 
--		ParentEmployeeKey=18 who is Jo Brown.

--		What to dislay ...

--		List the employees and the managers they report to. Again, all data needed is within the DimEmployee 
--		table. Include the EmployeeKey, first name, last name, and then the ParentEmployeeKey, 
--		and corresponding first name, and last name. 
--		
--		Without any sort added, your first record should display as follows:

--		4	Rob	Walters		3	Roberto	Tamburello 

--		This record shows us that Rob is managed by Roberto.

--		Hint: Search for "self-joins." Many of the self-join demos show the same Employee--Manager example.
--		Notice that you will join the table to itself and notice what you will do differntly in your ON statement.
 
--      Include the code you used to determine the answer. 
--		Include a comment with the number of records returned.

--		Records: 295
